The first solution, using the algorithm taught in school, is:

> Start by choosing a number $ i $ starting with $ 2 $ (the smallest prime number)
> Test the divisibility of the number $ n $ by $ i $, next for each one:
>
>> - If $ n $ is divisible by $ i $, then the result is
>> the new number $ n $ is reduced, while at the same time
>> the largest number $i$ found is stored.
>>
>> - If $ n $ IS NOT divisible by $ i $, $i$ is incremented by 1
> up to $ n $.

> Finally:

>>
>> - Otherwise, then the largest number $i$ found would be the largest prime factor.

## Second approach, limiting to half iterations

Since by going through and proving the divisibility of a number $ i $ up to $ n $
there are also "remainder" numbers that are also divisible by their opposite,
let's call it $ j $.

At first it seemed attractive to test numbers $ i $ up to half of $ n $ then
test whether $ i $ or $ j $ are prime. 2 problems arise:

- Testing whether a number is prime could involve increasing the number of
iterations since now the problem would become O(N^2) complex in the worst cases

- Discarding all $ j $ could mean discarding the correct solution.

Both problems were detected when using different sets of test inputs.

## Final solution using some optimization

A solution apparently accepted in the community as an optimization of the first
brute force algorithm consists of limiting the search to $ \sqrt{n} $.

Apparently it is a mathematical conjecture without proof
(if it exists, please send it to me).

Found the correct result in all test cases.
