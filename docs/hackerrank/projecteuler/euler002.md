# [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler002)

- Difficulty: #easy
- Category: #ProjectEuler+

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with $ 1 $ and $ 2 $, the first $ 10 $ terms will be:

$$ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 $$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
$ N $, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Input Format

First line contains $ T $ that denotes the number of test cases. This is
followed by $ T $ lines, each containing an integer, $ N $.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 10 \leq N \leq 4 Ã— 10^{16} $

## Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.

## Sample Input 0

```text
2
10
100
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
10
44
```

## Explanation 0

- For $ N = 10 $, we have $ \{2, 8\} $, sum is $ 10 $.

- For $ N = 100 $, we have $ \{2, 8, 34 \} $, sum is $ 44 $.
