Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type
id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1
type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

## Example

$ arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] $

There are two each of types  and , and one sighting of type . Pick the lower
of the two types seen twice: type .

## Function Description

Complete the migratoryBirds function in the editor below.

migratoryBirds has the following parameter(s):

- int arr[n]: the types of birds sighted

## Returns

- int: the lowest type id of the most frequently sighted birds

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n, the size of arr.
The second line describes arr as n space-separated integers, each a type
number of the bird sighted.

## Constraints

- $ 5 \leq n \leq 2 Ã— 10^5 $
- It is guaranteed that each type is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

## Sample Input 0

```text
6
1 4 4 4 5 3
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
4
```

## Explanation 0

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:

- Type 1: 1 bird
- Type 2: 0 birds
- Type 3: 1 bird
- Type 4: 3 birds
- Type 5: 1 bird

The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type 4, so we print
4 as our answer.

## Sample Input 1

```text
11
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 3 4
```

## Sample Output 1

```text
3
```

## Explanation 1

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:

- Type 1: 2
- Type 2: 2
- Type 3: 3
- Type 4: 3
- Type 5: 1

Two types have a frequency of $ 3 $, and the lower of those is type $ 3 $.
