# [Recursion: Davis' Staircase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-recursive-staircase)

Find the number of ways to get from the bottom of a staircase
to the top if you can jump 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time.

## Failed solution

This solution correctly calculates the result. The problem is its performance,
since due to the traversal of the recursion tree,
it is eventually easy to reach repeated cases that are recalculated each time.

```typescript
def step_perms_compute(n: number): number
    if (n == 0) {
      return 0
    }
    if (n == 1) {
      return 1
    }
    if (n == 2) {
      return 2
    }
    if (n == 3) {
      return 4
    }

    return
        step_perms_compute(n - 3) +
        step_perms_compute(n - 2) +
        step_perms_compute(n - 1)
```

## Alternative solution

The final solution introduces a simple caching mechanism,
so that repeated cases are not recalculated.

The trade-off is that the algorithm now requires
more memory to run in less time.

## Generalized solution

In order to comply with some clean code best practices,
I noticed that the step limit in the algorithm is a hard-coded number,
so to comply with the "no magic numbers" rule,
I was forced to find a more generalized solution.

Then I found the following pattern:

- First cases are:

$$ \begin{matrix}
    \text{stepPerms(0)} = 0 \\
    \text{stepPerms(1)} = 1 \\
    \text{stepPerms(2)} = 2 \\
  \end{matrix}
$$

- Next step combinations above 2 and less than the step limit are:

$$ \text{stepPerms(number of steps)} = 2^\text{number of steps} + 1 $$

- When `number of steps` are above the limit, the pattern is
the sum of latest `number of steps` previous calls of
`stepPerms(x)` results as follows:

$$ \displaystyle\sum_{
  i=\text{number of steps} - \text{limit}}
  ^\text{number of steps}
  stepPerms(\text{number of steps} - i)
$$
