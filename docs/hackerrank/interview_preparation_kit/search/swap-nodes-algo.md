# [Swap Nodes [Algo]](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/swap-nodes-algo)

Given a tree and an integer, K, we have to swap the subtrees of
all the nodes which are at a depth h

A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by one of the following properties:

- It can be empty (null).
- It contains a root node only.
- It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree,
    or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.

In-order traversal is performed as

1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit root.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

For this in-order traversal, start from the left child of the
root node and keep exploring the left subtree until you reach a leaf.
When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent,
check for a right child and visit it if there is one.
If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully.
If there is a right child, traverse its left subtree then
its right in the same manner.
Keep doing this until you have traversed the entire tree.
You will only store the values of a node as you visit
when one of the following is true:

- it is the first node visited, the first time visited
- it is a leaf, should only be visited once
- all of its subtrees have been explored,
    should only be visited once while this is true
- it is the root of the tree, the first time visited

**Swapping**: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node
has left subtree `L` and right subtree `R`, then after swapping,
the left subtree will be `R` and the right subtree, `L`.

For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node `1`.

```text
                                Depth
    1               1            [1]
   / \             / \
  2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
   \   \           \   \
    4   5           5   4        [3]
```

In-order traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.

**Swap operation**:

We define depth of a node as follows:

- The root node is at depth 1.
- If the depth of the parent node is d, then the depth of current node will be d+1.

Given a tree and an integer, `k`, in one operation, we need to swap
the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth h, where h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...].
In other words, if h is a multiple of k, swap the left and right
subtrees of that level.

You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..n]
and it is rooted at 1.
You have to perform t swap operations on it, and after each swap
operation print the in-order traversal of the current state of the tree.

## Function Description

Complete the swapNodes function in the editor below.
It should return a two-dimensional array where each element
is an array of integers representing the node indices of an in-order
traversal after a swap operation.

swapNodes has the following parameter(s):

- indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each `node[i]`,
    beginning with `node[1]`, the first element, as the root.
- queries: an array of integers, each representing a  value.

## Input Format

The first line contains n, number of nodes in the tree.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers, `a b`,
where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node.

**Note**: -1 is used to represent a null node.

The next line contains an integer, t, the size of .
Each of the next t lines contains an integer , each being a value .

## Output Format

For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your
in-order traversal to your result array.
After all swap operations have been performed, return your result array for printing.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq n \leq 1024 $
- $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $
- $ 1 \leq k \leq n $
- Either a = -1 or 2 <= a <= n
- Either b = -1 or 2 <= b <= n
- The index of a non-null child will always be greater than that of its parent.

## Sample Input 0

```text
3
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
2
1
1
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
3 1 2
2 1 3
```

## Explanation 0

As nodes 2 and 3 have no children, swapping will not have any effect on them.
We only have to swap the child nodes of the root node.

```text
    1   [s]       1    [s]       1
   / \      ->   / \        ->  / \
  2   3 [s]     3   2  [s]     2   3
```

Note: [s] indicates that a swap operation is done at this depth.

## Sample Input 1

```text
5
2 3
-1 4
-1 5
-1 -1
-1 -1
1
2
```

## Sample Output 1

```text
4 2 1 5 3
```

## Explanation 1

Swapping child nodes of node 2 and 3 we get

```text
    1                  1
   / \                / \
  2   3   [s]  ->    2   3
   \   \            /   /
    4   5          4   5
```

## Sample Input 2

```text
11
2 3
4 -1
5 -1
6 -1
7 8
-1 9
-1 -1
10 11
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
2

4
```

## Sample Output 2

```text
2 9 6 4 1 3 7 5 11 8 10
2 6 9 4 1 3 7 5 10 8 11
```

## Explanation 2

Here we perform swap operations at the nodes whose depth is either
`2` or `4` for `K = 2` and then at nodes whose depth is 4 for `K = 4`.

```text

         1                     1                          1
        / \                   / \                        / \
       /   \                 /   \                      /   \
      2     3    [s]        2     3                    2     3
     /      /                \     \                    \     \
    /      /                  \     \                    \     \
   4      5          ->        4     5          ->        4     5
  /      / \                  /     / \                  /     / \
 /      /   \                /     /   \                /     /   \
6      7     8   [s]        6     7     8   [s]        6     7     8
 \          / \            /           / \              \         / \
  \        /   \          /           /   \              \       /   \
   9      10   11        9           11   10              9     10   11
```
