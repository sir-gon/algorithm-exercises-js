# [Dynamic Programming: Max Array Sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/max-array-sum)

- Difficulty:  `#medium`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvingIntermediate`

Given an array of integers, find the subset of
non-adjacent elements with the maximum sum.
Calculate the sum of that subset.
It is possible that the maximum sum is `0`, the case when all elements are negative.

## Example

`arr = [-2, 1, 3, -4, 5]`

The following subsets with more than  element exist.
These exclude the empty subset and single element subsets which are also valid.

```text
Subset      Sum
[-2, 3, 5]   6
[-2, 3]      1
[-2, -4]    -6
[-2, 5]      3
[1, -4]     -3
[1, 5]       6
[3, 5]       8
```

The maximum subset sum is . Note that any individual element is a subset as well.

`arr = [-2, -3, -1]`

In this case, it is best to choose no element: return `0`.

## Function Description

Complete the `maxSubsetSum` function in the editor below.

maxSubsetSum has the following parameter(s):

- `int arr[n]`: an array of integers

## Returns

- `int`: the maximum subset sum

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `arr[i]`.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- $ -10^4 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^4 $

## Sample Input 0

```text
5
3 7 4 6 5
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
13
```

## Explanation 0

Our possible subsets are `[3, 4, 5]`. `[3, 4]`, `[3, 6]`, `[3, 5]`, `[7, 6]`,
`[7, 5]` and `[4, 5]`.
The largest subset sum is `13` from subset `[7, 6]`

## Sample Input 1

```text
5
2 1 5 8 4
```

## Sample Output 1

```text
11
```

## Explanation 1

Our subsets are `[2, 5, 4]`, `[2, 5]`, `[2, 8]`, `[2, 4]`, `[1, 8]`,
`[1, 4]` and `[5, 4]`.
The maximum subset sum is `11` from the first subset listed.

## Sample Input 2

```text
5
3 5 -7 8 10
```

## Sample Output 2

```text
15
```

## Explanation 2

Our subsets are `[3, -7, 10]`, `[3, 8]`, `[3,10]`, `[5, 8]`,
`[5, 10]` and `[-7, 10]`.

The maximum subset sum is `15` from the fifth subset listed.
