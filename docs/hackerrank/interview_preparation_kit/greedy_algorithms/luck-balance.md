# [Greedy Algorithms: Luck Balance](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/luck-balance)

- Difficulty:  `#easy`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvingBasic`

Lena is preparing for an important coding competition that is preceded
by a number of sequential preliminary contests.
Initially, her luck balance is 0.
She believes in "saving luck", and wants to check her theory.
Each contest is described by two integers, `L[i]` and `T[i]`:

- `L[i]` is the amount of luck associated with a contest.
If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by `L[i]`;
if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by `L[i]`.

- `T[i]` denotes the contest's importance rating.
It's equal to `1` if the contest is important, and it's equal to `0` if it's unimportant.

If Lena loses no more than `k` important contests, what is the maximum amount
of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests?
This value may be negative.

## Example

```text
Contest     L[i]    T[i]
1           5       1
2           1       1
3           4       0
```

If Lena loses all of the contests, her will be `5 + 1 +4 = 10`.
Since she is allowed to lose  important contests,
and there are only `2` important contests,
she can lose all three contests to maximize her luck at `10`.

If `k = 1`, she has to win at least  of the  important contests.
She would choose to win the lowest value important contest worth `1`.
Her final luck will be `5 + 4 - 1 = 8`.

## Function Description

Complete the luckBalance function in the editor below.

luckBalance has the following parameter(s):

- `int k`: the number of important contests Lena can lose
- `int contests[n][2]`: a 2D array of integers where each `contests[i]`
contains two integers that represent the luck balance and importance of the  contest

## Returns

- `int`: the maximum luck balance achievable

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers  `n` and `k`,
the number of preliminary contests and the maximum number
of important contests Lena can lose.

Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers,
`L[i]` and `T[i]`, the contest's luck balance and its importance rating.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq n \leq 100 $
- $ 0 \leq k \leq N $
- $ 1 \leq L[i] \leq 10^4 $
- $ T[i] \isin \{0,1\} $

## Sample Input

```text
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
6 3         n = 6, k = 3
5 1         contests = [[5, 1], [2, 1], [1, 1], [8, 1], [10, 0], [5, 0]]
2 1
1 1
8 1
10 0
5 0
```

## Sample Output

```text
29
```

## Explanation

There are `n = 6` contests. Of these contests, `4` are important
and she cannot lose more than  of them.
Lena maximizes her luck if she wins the $ 3^{rd} $ important contest
(where `L[i] = 1`) and loses all of the other five contests for a total
luck balance of `5 + 2 + 8 + 10 + 5 - 1 = 29`.
