# [Dictionaries and Hashmaps: Frequency Queries](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/frequency-queries)

- Difficulty:  `#medium`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvingIntermediate`

You are given  queries. Each query is of the form two integers described below:

- `1 x`: Insert x in your data structure.
- `2 y`: Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present.
- `3 z`: Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly `z`.
If yes, print `1` else `0`.

The queries are given in the form of a 2-D array `queries` of
size where `queries[i][0]` contains the operation,
and `queries[i][0]` contains the data element.

## Example

The results of each operation are:

```text
Operation   Array   Output
(1,1)       [1]
(2,2)       [1]
(3,2)                   0
(1,1)       [1,1]
(1,1)       [1,1,1]
(2,1)       [1,1]
(3,2)                   1
```

Return an array with the output: [0, 1].

## Function Description

Complete the freqQuery function in the editor below.

freqQuery has the following parameter(s):

- `int queries[q][2]`: a 2-d array of integers

## Returns

- `int[]`: the results of queries of type `3`

## Input Format

The first line contains of an integer `q`, the number of queries.

Each of the next `q` lines contains two space-separated integers,
`queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]`.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq q \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq x, y, z \leq 10^9 $
- All $ queries[i][0] \isin \{1, 2, 3\} $
- $ 1 \leq queries[i][1] \leq 10^9 $

## Sample Input 0

```text
8
1 5
1 6
3 2
1 10
1 10
1 6
2 5
3 2
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
0
1
```

## Explanation 0

For the first query of type `3`, there is no integer
whose frequency is `2` (`array = [5, 6]`).
So answer is `0`.

For the second query of type `3`, there are two integers
in `array = [6, 10, 10, 6]` whose frequency is `2`(integer = `6` and `10`).
So, the answer is `1`.

## Sample Input 1

```†ext
4
3 4
2 1003
1 16
3 1
```

## Sample Output 1

```†ext
0
1
```

## Explanation 1

For the first query of type `3`, there is no integer of frequency `4`.
The answer is `0`. For the second query of type `3`,
there is one integer, `16` of frequency `1` so the answer is `1`.

## Sample Input 2

```text
10
1 3
2 3
3 2
1 4
1 5
1 5
1 4
3 2
2 4
3 2
```

## Sample Output 2

```text
0
1
1

```

## Explanation 2

When the first output query is run, the array is empty.
We insert two `4`'s and two `5`'s before the second output query,
`arr = [4, 5, 5, 4]` so there are two instances of elements occurring twice.
We delete a `4` and run the same query.
Now only the instances of `5` satisfy the query.
