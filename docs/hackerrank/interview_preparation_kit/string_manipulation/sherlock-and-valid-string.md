# [String Manipulation: Sherlock and the Valid String](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-valid-string)

- Difficulty:  `#medium`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvinIntermediate` `#strings`

Sherlock considers a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear
the same number of times.
It is also valid if he can remove just ´1´ character at  index in the string,
and the remaining characters will occur the same number of times.
Given a string `s`, determine if it is valid.
If so, return `YES`, otherwise return `NO`.

## Example

`s = abc`

This is a valid string because frequencies are `{a: 1, b: 1, c: 1}`.

`s = abcc`

This is a valid string because we can remove one `c` and have  of
each character in the remaining string.

`s = abccc`

This string is not valid as we can only remove `1` occurrence of `c`.
That leaves character frequencies of `{a: 1, b: 1, c: 2}`.

## Function Description

Complete the isValid function in the editor below.

isValid has the following parameter(s):

- `string s`: a string

## Returns

- `string`: either `YES` or `NO`

## Input Format

A single string `s`.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5  $
- Each character `s[i]` $ \in $ `ascii[a-z]`

## Sample Input 0

```text
aabbcd
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
NO
```

## Explanation 0

Given `s = "abbcd"`, we would need to remove two characters,
both `c` and `d` -> `aabb` or a and b  abcd, to make it valid.
We are limited to removing only one character, so `s` is invalid.

## Sample Input 1

```text
aabbccddeefghi
```

## Sample Output 1

```text
NO
```

## Explanation 1

Frequency counts for the letters are as follows:

```text
{'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2, 'd': 2, 'e': 2, 'f': 1, 'g': 1, 'h': 1, 'i': 1}
```

There are two ways to make the valid string:

- Remove `4` characters with a frequency of `1`: `{fghi}`.
- Remove `5` characters of frequency `2`: `{abcde}`.
Neither of these is an option.

## Sample Input 2

```text
abcdefghhgfedecba
```

## Sample Output 2

```text
YES
```

## Explanation 2

All characters occur twice except for `e`  which occurs `3` times.
We can delete one instance of `e` to have a valid string.
