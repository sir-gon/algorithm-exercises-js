How many characters should one delete to make two given strings anagrams
of each other?

A student is taking a cryptography class and has found anagrams to be very useful.
Two strings are anagrams of each other if the first
string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string.
In other words, both strings must contain the same
exact letters in the same exact frequency.
For example, `bacdc` and `dcbac` are anagrams,
but `bacdc` and `dcbad` are not.

The student decides on an encryption scheme that involves two large strings.
The encryption is dependent on the minimum number of character deletions
required to make the two strings anagrams. Determine this number.

Given two strings, `a` and `b`, that may or may not be of the same length,
determine the minimum number of character deletions required
to make `a` and `b` anagrams.
Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.

## Example

```python
a = 'cde'
b = 'dcf'
```

Delete `e` from `a` and `f` from `b` so that the remaining strings
are `cd` and `dc` which are anagrams. This takes `2`  character deletions.

## Function Description

Complete the makeAnagram function in the editor below.

makeAnagram has the following parameter(s):

- `string a`: a string
- `string b`: another string

## Returns

- `int`: the minimum total characters that must be deleted

## Input Format

The first line contains a single string, `a`.
The second line contains a single string, `b`.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq |a|, |b| \leq 10^4 $
- The strings `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters, ascii[a-z].

## Sample Input

```text
cde
abc
```

## Sample Output

```text
4
```

## Explanation

Delete the following characters from the strings make them anagrams:

1. Remove `d` and `e` from `cde` to get `c`.
2. Remove `a` and `b` from `abc` to get `c`.

It takes `4` deletions to make both strings anagrams.
