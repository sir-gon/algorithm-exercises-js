# [Arrays: Array Manipulation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/crush)

Perform m operations on an array and print the maximum of the values.

- Difficulty:  ` #hard `
- Category: ` #ProblemSolvingIntermediate `

Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each
operation add a value to each the array element between two given indices,
inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum
value in the array.

## Example

Queries are interpreted as follows:

```text
    a b k
    1 5 3
    4 8 7
    6 9 1
```

Add the values of  between the indices  and  inclusive:

```text
index->  1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10
        [0,0,0, 0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0]
        [3,3,3, 3, 3,0,0,0,0, 0]
        [3,3,3,10,10,7,7,7,0, 0]
        [3,3,3,10,10,8,8,8,1, 0]
```

The largest value is `10` after all operations are performed.

## Function Description

Complete the function arrayManipulation in the editor below.

arrayManipulation has the following parameters:

- `int n` - the number of elements in the array
- `int queries[q][3]` - a two dimensional array of queries where
each `queries[i]` contains three integers, `a`, `b`, and `k`.

## Returns

- int - the maximum value in the resultant array

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers `n` and `m`, the size of
the array and the number of operations.
Each of the next `m` lines contains three space-separated integers
`a`, `b` and `k`, the left index, right index and summand.

## Constraints

- $ 3 \leq n \leq 10^7 $
- $ 1 \leq m \leq 2*10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq a \leq b \leq n $
- $ 0 \leq k \leq 10^9 $

## Sample Input

```text
5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100
```

## Sample Output

```text
200
````

## Explanation

After the first update the list is `100 100 0 0 0`.
After the second update list is `100 200 100 100 100`.
After the third update list is `100 200 200 200 100`.

The maximum value is `200`.
