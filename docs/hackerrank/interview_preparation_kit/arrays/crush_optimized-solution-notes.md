# [Array Manipulation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/crush)

Perform m operations on an array and print the maximum of the values.

## Solution sources

### Brute force idea

The first solution attempt is based on the idea of going through:

> each row and then,
> > each sub-set of elements affected by the operation.

With this principle, the algorithm becomes O(N^2)

### Optimized

Reading about posible optimizations,
I found the possibility of summarizing the interior traversal with
addition operations for each element in each row of operations,
in only 2 constant operations, which represents the necessary values so that
in a single final traversal, the sum values can be obtained "by drag".
The algorithm is called "prefix sum."
