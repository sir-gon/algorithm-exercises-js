# [Arrays: Left Rotation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation)

Given an array and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array.

- Difficulty: #easy
- Category: #ProblemSolvingBasic

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements
$ 1 $ unit to the left. For example, if $ 2 $ left rotations are performed
on array $ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] $, then the array would become $ [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] $.
Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation.
This is called a circular array.

Given an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers and a number, $ d $, perform $ d $ left
rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single
line of space-separated integers.

## Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

- int a[n]: the array to rotate
- int d: the number of rotations

## Returns

- int a'[n]: the rotated array

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ d $, the size
of $ a $ and the number of left rotations.
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers, each an $ a[i] $.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq d \leq n $
- $ 1 \leq a[i] \leq 10^6 $

## Sample Input

```text
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Sample Output

```text
5 1 2 3 4
```

## Explanation

When we perform $ d = 4 $ left rotations, the array undergoes the following
sequence of changes:

> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
> -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
> -> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
> -> [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
