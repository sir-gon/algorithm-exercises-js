# [Balanced Brackets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/balanced-brackets/)

Given a string containing three types of brackets, determine if it is balanced.

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters:
(, ), {, }, [, or ].

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket
(i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or })
of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets:
[], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses
are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents
in between { and } are not balanced.
The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket,
(, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single,
unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if
the following conditions are met:

- It contains no unmatched brackets.
- The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched
pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given `n` strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence
of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return `YES`.
Otherwise, return `NO`.

## Function Description

Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.

isBalanced has the following parameter(s):

- `string s`: a string of brackets

## Returns

- `string`: either `YES` or `NO`

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer `n`, the number of strings.
Each of the next `n` lines contains a single string `s`, a sequence of brackets.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 $
- $ 1 \leq \lvert s \rvert \leq 10^3 $, where $ \lvert s \rvert  $ is the length
of the sequence.
- All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]` }.

## Output Format

For each string, return YES or NO.

## Sample Input

```text
STDIN           Function
-----           --------
3               n = 3
{[()]}          first s = '{[()]}'
{[(])}          second s = '{[(])}'
{{[[(())]]}}    third s ='{{[[(())]]}}'
```

## Sample Output

```text
YES
NO
YES
```

## Explanation

The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string.
The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed
by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [(]).
The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string.
