# [Sorting: Bubble Sort](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort/)

Find the minimum number of conditional checks taking place in Bubble Sort

- Difficulty:  `#easy`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvingBasic` `#sorting`

Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
        }
    }

}
```

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order
using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

1. `Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.`, where *`numSums`* is
the number of swaps that took place.
2. `First Element: firstElement`, where *`firstElement`* is
the first element in the sorted array.
3. `Last Element: lastElement`, where *`lastElement`* is
the last element in the sorted array.

**Hint**: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable
that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

## Example

```text
swap    a
0       [6,4,1]
1       [4,6,1]
2       [4,1,6]
3       [1,4,6]
```

The steps of the bubble sort are shown above. It took `3` swaps to sort the array.
Output is:

```text
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 6
```

## Function Description

Complete the function countSwaps in the editor below.

countSwaps has the following parameter(s):

- `int a[n]`: an array of integers to sort

## Prints

Print the three lines required, then return. No return value is expected.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`, the size of the array `a`.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a[i]`.

## Constraints

- $ 2 \leq n \leq 600 $
- $ a \leq a[i] \leq 2 \times 10^6 $

## Output Format

## Sample Input 0

```text
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
3       a[] size n = 3
1 2 3   a = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Sample Output 0

```text
Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
Explanation 0
```

The array is already sorted, so `0` swaps take place.

## Sample Input 1

```text
3
3 2 1
```

## Sample Output 1

```text
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
```

## Explanation 1

The array is not sorted, and its initial values are: `{1, 2, 3}`.
The following `3` swaps take place:

```text
{3, 2, 1} -> {2, 3, 1}
{2, 3, 1} -> {2, 1, 3}
{2, 1, 3} -> {1, 2, 3}
```

At this point the array is sorted and the three lines of output are printed to stdout.
